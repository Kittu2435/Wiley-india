What is cloud computing?

->cloud computing is the delivery of computing services—including servers, storage, databases, 
networking, software, analytics, and intelligence—over the Internet to offer faster innovation, 
flexible resources, and economies of scale.


characteristics of CC:

-> Resource pooling means that a cloud service provider can share resources among several 
clients, providing everyone with a different set of services as per their requirements.
 Multiple clients are provided service from a same physical resource.

Measured service:

->The resource utilization is tracked for each application and occupant, 
it will provide both the user and the resource provider with an account of what has been used. 
This is done for various reasons like monitoring billing and effective use of resource.

Rapid Elasticity: 

->The Computing services should have IT resources that are able to scale out and in quickly 
and on as needed basis. 
Whenever the user require services it is provided to him and it is scale out as soon as its 
requirement gets over.

ON Demand Self Service: 

->The Cloud computing services does not require any human administrators, 
user themselves are able to provision, monitor and manage computing resources as needed.

->Broad network access :The Computing services are generally provided over standard networks and 
                        heterogeneous devices.

Amazon Simple Storage service(S3)

-->Amazon S3 treats data as individual objects.They can able to use store and retreive any amount
of data any time. We can access when it needed. It makes copies on mutliple devices so that data
cannot be lost.

The abstraction away from the lower layers of storage and the 
separation of data from its metadata comes with a  number of benefits. 
For one, Amazon can provide a highly durable storage service for the fraction of the cost of block 
storage. 
You also only pay for the amount of storage you actually use. 
Therefore you don’t need to second-guess and pre-allocate disk space.


AWS SERVICES: 

-> STORAGE 
   ---> S3 (SIMPLE STORAGE SERVICE) IS STORAGE FOR INTERNET. WE CAN USE IT FOR STORING DATA

RETREVING DATA AT ANY TIME FROM ANYWHERE IN THE WEB.

AMAZON S3 CONCEPTS:

Topics
• Buckets (p. 2)
• Objects (p. 3)
• Keys (p. 3)
• Regions (p. 3)
• Amazon S3 data consistency model (p. 3)

A bucket is a container for objects stored in Amazon S3. Every object is contained in a bucket.

Objects are the fundamental entities stored in Amazon S3. Objects consist of object data and 
metadata. The data portion is opaque to Amazon S3.

A key is the unique identifier for an object within a bucket. Every object in a bucket has exactly
one key.

You can choose the geographical AWS Region where Amazon S3 will store the buckets that you create.

***Amazon S3 Glacier

Use Amazon S3 Glacier to provide durable and extremely low-cost storage for infrequently 
used data with security features for data archiving and backup.

Amazon DynamoDB Documentation


Amazon DynamoDB is a fully managed NoSQL database service that provides fast and predictable 
performance with seamless scalability. 
We are using DynamoDB to store scores,Id,Name in database table.
We can use Amazon DynamoDB to create a database table 
that can store and retrieve any amount of data


AWS Lambda Functions

With AWS Lambda, you can run code without provisioning or managing servers. 
You pay only for the compute time that you consume—there’s no charge when your code isn’t running.
You can run code for virtually any type of application or backend service—all with zero 
administration. 
Just upload your code and Lambda takes care of everything required to run and scale your code 
with high availability. You can set up your code to automatically trigger from other AWS services 
or call it directly from any web or mobile app.

Trigger used by lambda functions to link s3 to dynamoDB table.

AWS Amplify Documentation

AWS Amplify enables developers to develop and deploy cloud-powered mobile and web apps. 
The Amplify Framework is a comprehensive set of SDKs, libraries, tools, and documentation 
for client app development. The Amplify Console provides a continuous delivery and hosting 
service for web applications.

It helps to add feature like authentication to our app.

What we’ll build

This tutorial guides you through setting up a backend and integrating that backend with your 
React app. 
You will create a “Todo app” with a GraphQL API and to store and retrieve items in a cloud database. 
In addition, we’ll demonstrate how to authenticate users, communicate with our API, 
and set up continuous deployment and hosting.

***********
Add auth

amplify add auth

to deploy service we use push i.e,

amplify push

To view deployed services we use 

amplify console

AWS API Gateway


Amazon API Gateway enables you to create and deploy your own REST and WebSocket APIs at any scale. 
You can create robust, secure, and scalable APIs that access AWS or other web services, 
as well as data that’s stored in the AWS Cloud. 
You can create APIs to use in your own client applications, or you can make your APIs available 
to third-party app developers.
